Zutari: Junior Unity Developer Interview Task

Did this assessment/project for a job application. Learned a lot more about json and api's as I have used them before in android studio but never in Unity. Was afun project to take part in with the first task requiring me to use a cube and rigid body physics to move and make adjustments to the cube. Also edited its colour using the renderer and key inputs and well as reflecting the cube in the opposite axis when it went out of bounds. The second task required me to use Unity's web functionality to pull api weather data, interpret json files and display the weather data on a UI. All in all was a great test.
